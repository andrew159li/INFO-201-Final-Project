# Study on World Income Per Capita

### What is the study about?
Are the richest countries the ones that produce the most CO2? Are they the most educated? Are they the ones with the least unemployment? With a set of data from WorldBank, we conducted a study on how a country's income per capita might relate to its **CO2 emissions** per capita, **employment to population ratio**, and the **population in primary/secondary education systems.**

### How did we conduct the study?
We established three guiding questions (one for each topic) and answered the questions with different kinds of graphs.

1. How does employment to population ratio vary by income brackets in each region?
2. Is there a correlation between a country’s CO2 emissions produced and income per capita?
3. Is there a correlation between a country’s current population in primary/secondary schools and income per capita?

The interactive graphs and the insights can be found on the next few pages.
