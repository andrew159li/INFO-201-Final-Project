# Final Project
## Domain of Interest

We are interested in the topic of global economy because by analyzing global economic data, we will be able to better understand the complexities of global activity. Since the economy is something that affects everyone at all stages of their life, we felt that analyzing this topic would be beneficial for learning how the economy is changing, and why these changes are happening.

### Other examples of data driven project that are related to subject (3)
- The World in 2050
- Annual Growth of GDP Per Capita
- Global Economic Effects of COVID-19

### Project descriptions
- The World in 2050 from Pricewaterhouse Coopers (PwC) looked at the IMF for 2016 estimates, as well as the PwC analysis for projections to 2050 in order to provide estimates for the economy of countries worldwide. Some of these estimates include analyzing growth rate, economic power, and overall economic rankings.
- The Annual Growth of GDP Per Capita looked at the data from WorldBank, analyzed, and interactively visualized the data based on constant local currency. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.
- Global Economic Effects of COVID-19 (May 2019) from the Congressional Research Service analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on global economic growth and trade as well as global policy responses. It also looks to the future and provides estimations for debt, new markets, and developed economies. It uses data from sources like the World Trade Organization, the Federal Reserve, and the International Monetary Fund.

### What data-driven question do we hope to answer about the topic (at least 3)
- What kind of correlation is there between a country's debt and their different facets of development?
- How does the economy change based on current events happening in the world?
- How does the growth rate among different income groups vary by country?

### How the questions could be answered using data
- We can look at data sets dealing with debt and development and then compare the two; there is also a data set containing world development indicators which also includes debt information (both by country and citizens), so we could compare these facets within the data set as well.
- We could look a data set containing information that represents global economy, such as yearly GDP or average consumer spending, and then compare it to world events happening during the same time periods to see how different events affect the global economy.
- We could look at a data set containing populations of different countries over the years and a data set containing different income groups over the years; from this, we could compare the growth rate of countries according to population with different income groups.

- [Global Population Estimates by Countries](https://www.kaggle.com/theworldbank/global-population-estimates)

### How the data was collected or generated
- The data was published by World Bank and "compiled from officially-recognized international sources". Some of these sources include studies in journals published through Wiley Online Library, SAGE Journals, Taylor & Francis Online. The data itself contains "the most current and accurate global development data available, and includes national, regional and global estimates."
- The data was published by World Bank and contains "timely, comprehensive data on trends in external debt in low- and middle-income countries", drawn from The World Bank's Debtor Reporting System (DRS). The data itself is concerned with worldwide geographic coverage, and a wide range of economic status, including low income, lower-middle income, and upper middle income.
- The data was published by World Bank and presents population and other demographic estimates starting in 1960. It also provides estimates through 2060. The population data includes various age groups, sex, urban/rural, fertility data, mortality data, and migration data.

### How many observations (rows) are in your data?
- 263
- 135
- 44812

### How many features (columns) are in the data?
- 61
- 32
- 95

### What questions can be answered using the data in this data set?
- We can use the World Development Indicator data set to help answer all three questions. It has an extremely wide range of information which covers what we need in order to answer the questions, from consumer spending to population.
- We can use the International Debt Statistics data set to answer the first question, which deals directly with debt. We would have to also use the WDI data set to answer the questions, however.
- We can use the Global Population Estimates by Countries data set to answer the third questions, which deals directly with the question of populations of different countries. We would probably pair this data set with the first (WDI) or second (IDS) in order to get necessary information about economic status.
